# linkedin-bot
- A LinkedIn bot made in python 

A bot that views profiles on your linkedIn account for you sometimes, and more. 


***LinkedIn has changed since I last worked/used this bot, and as a result it doesn't currently work. I'm aware of the issues and plan to fix them as time permits between university and work. 

## Improvement list:
- Address LinkedIn's changes(new profile urls, etc)
- Implement LiteSQL to keep track of profiles that have been visited, etc.
- Implement job search and application functionality, using LinkedIn's Easy Apply. As well as grabbing external job application links.
